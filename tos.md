Thank you for using Ovation! These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use

	scientific or technical data.  When you use Ovation, directly or via a third

	your data to provide the features of our Services to you, including data
	previews and visualizations, hosting and backing up files, and sharing data at
	your direction. By using Our Products & Services, you give us the permissions
	we need to use your data solely to provide our Services. You also grant the

	account or disclosure of your account password.
